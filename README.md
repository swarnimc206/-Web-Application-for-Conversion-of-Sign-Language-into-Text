# SignSpeak: Web Application for Sign Language to Text Conversion  

## Overview  
**SignSpeak** is a web application designed to translate sign language into text, enabling seamless communication for individuals with hearing or speech impairments. The application integrates real-time gesture recognition and advanced machine learning models to ensure accurate and efficient translations. Developed under the guidance of **Professor Pratima Panigrahi**, the project focuses on combining cutting-edge technologies to bridge communication gaps.  

## Features  
- Real-time **gesture recognition** and translation through an interactive web application built with **Streamlit**.  
- Image preprocessing using **OpenCV**, converting visual data into numerical values for analysis.  
- Accurate gesture prediction using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  
- Video sequence analysis powered by **RNNs** and **LSTMs**, with advanced sequence modeling via **Transformers**.  
- Model training and fine-tuning performed using **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**, ensuring high accuracy and robust performance.  

## Skills and Technologies  
- **Frameworks and Tools**: Streamlit, OpenCV  
- **Deep Learning**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformer Architecture  
- **Programming Languages**: Python  
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch  
- **Sequence Modeling**: Video sequence analysis and advanced gesture translation
